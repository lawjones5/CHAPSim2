# Overview

**CHAPSim2** (**CH**annel **A**nd **P**ipe flow **Sim**ulation) is a high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) solver for incompressible flow and heat transfer with full MPI parallelization. This repository contains the latest stable version of the software.

### License

This software is released under the BSD-3-Clause License. See the LICENSE file for details.

### Features

- **Incompressible Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)** capabilities
- **Fortran** source code + **Python Interface** for input generation and visualization
- Works with both **Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates**
- **High Accuracy & Stability**: Uses a **fully staggered approach**, solving conservative variables directly (mass flux, heat flux), and other key variables for better numerical stability
- **Advanced Numerical Methods**: Offers optional **2nd to 6th-order accurate** finite difference schemes, with both implicit compact and explicit options
- **Powerful FFT Integration**: Supports **3-D FFT** and **2-D FFT** with arbitrary grid stretching for various boundary conditions **via 2decomp&FFT library**
- **Proven Scalability**:
  - 2-D pencil domain decomposition using 2decomp&FFT library
  - **Successfully tested on ARCHER2**, scaling efficiently up to 32,000+ cores
- **Handles Complex Geometries**:
  - Features **immersed boundary methods (IBM)**, allowing simulations of complex geometry
- **Heat Transfer Studies**:
  - Includes **conjugate heat transfer** capabilities for nuclear thermal hydraulics and energy applications

# Installation

### Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CCP-NTH/CHAPSim2.git
cd CHAPSim2
```

### Build

1. Make the build script executable:

```bash
chmod +x build_chapsim.sh
```

2. Run the build script:

```bash
./build_chapsim.sh
```

3. When prompted, select options for:
   - Refreshing and rebuilding the 2decomp library
   - Running `make clean` before compilation
   - Building in debug mode

Upon successful completion, the compiled executable `CHAPSim` will be available in the `bin/` directory.

---

# Test

In the folder `tests`, there are 14 test cases. Run below command to test all:

```bash
./run_regression.sh
```
Metrics tolerances are stored in `tests/tools/tolerances.json`

# Running Simulations

### Setup

Copy the run script to your simulation case directory:

```bash
cp prepost/useful_scripts/run_local.sh /path/to/your/case/
```

### Execution

1. Run the script:

```bash
./run_local.sh
```

2. Follow the prompts to configure:
   - Number of processors (default: 1)
   - Debugging tools (Valgrind/LLDB)

3. The script will:
   - Create a timestamped directory with source files
   - Configure unique log filenames
   - Execute CHAPSim with your specified options

Simulation output will be saved to a timestamped log file (e.g., `output_chapsim2_2025-05-07_15.30.log`).
